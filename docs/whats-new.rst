.. _whats-new.0.5.0:

v0.5.0 (2021/7/9)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

v0.4.0 (2021/6/9)
-------------------

.. _whats-new.0.2.0:

v0.2.0 (2021/4/9)
-----------------

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Removed `replace_x_y_nominal_lat_lon` from `combined_preprocessing` due to ongoing performance issues with dask (#75, #85, #94) (#104). By `Julius Busecke <https://github.com/jbusecke>`_
- Further refactor of `replace_x_y_nominal_lat_lon`, which avoids missing values in the dimension coordinates (#66) (#79). By `Julius Busecke <https://github.com/jbusecke>`_

- Consistent treatment of cf-style bounds. The combination of `parse_lon_lat_bounds`,`maybe_convert_bounds_to_vertex`, `maybe_convert_vertex_to_bounds`, and `sort_vertex_order` applied on the dataset, assures that all datasets have both conventions available and the vertex order is the same. By `Julius Busecke <https://github.com/jbusecke>`_
